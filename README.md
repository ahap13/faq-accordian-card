## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap - CSS Library
- jQuery - JS Library


### What I learned

I realized I may have taken some unnecessary steps making the mobile version that I could've avoided by keeping responsiveness in mind while I created the page. Additionally, I am sure I could have made this site without the JS script, however including it was the easiest way for me.
